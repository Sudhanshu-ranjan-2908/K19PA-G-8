OPD Services :</h2>
 The Outpatient Department (OPD) at AHC,</br> 
Bijnor is completely paperless from the day of its inception. </br> 
The OPD occupies a very important value in any Institute or hospital and is considered to be a window to the hospital care.</br> 
 OPD in a Medical Institute has broadly 3 roles- Patient care, medical education and research.</br> 
<h2 style="color:yellow">
Patient Care : </h2>
The patients in OPD need compassionate care, </br> 
clear communication and convenience. </br> 
We, at AHC Bijnor have endeavor to provide this along with concern for the patients. </br> 
Inpatient care, sanatorium for chronic illnesses and </br> 
hospitalization are now showing decreasing trends globally and</br> 
 are restricted to those with serious illness or requiring major operative procedures.</br> 
 Even the surgeries are being performed during OPD or day care in well patients;</br> 
 admissions are reserved for patient requiring detail workup, observation or complex surgeries. </br> 
The coordinated OPD services also minimize patient time for hospitalization as</br> 
 the Pre-operative check-ups are also provided on an OPD basis. </br> 
At AHC Bijnor, OPD services were launched on 27 th jan 2020 with basic clinical departments</br> 
 and diagnostic facility in the ground floor of the OPD Complex. </br> 
This was expanded to first floor in 2020and diagnostic facility shifted to IPD block in 2020. </br> 
Since the launch, total new patients seen in OPD being 40,000.</br>  
The patient once registered can visit any number of OPDs. </br> 
For the year 2020-21, we had 40,000 new patients registered in the AHC OPD .</br> 
Education: 
The OPD is the most appropriate place for education- both for patients</br> 
 and for healthcare professionals.</br> 
 For patients, OPD provides a place to consult multiple doctors,</br> 
 health educators and counselors. </br> 
The resident doctors are a link between medical experts and </br> 
patients and help in clarifying many issues the patient may have.</br> 
 Our faculty always makes an effort to identify those requiring more attention and those requiring urgent evaluation. </br> 
The OPD is also a perfect place for learning communication skills for students. </br> 
Under the guidance of faculty members and resident doctors,</br> 
 students are learning history taking and examination with most time-efficient interviewing questions and skills.</br> 
 In fact, OPD provides the perfect place for vicarious learning,</br> 
 i.e., learning by observing- for patients, students, resident and faculty.</br> 
<h2 style="color:yellow">
Research:</h2>
 Availability of Computerised Patient Management System (CPMS) has opened a new facet for conducting research in OPD setting.</br> 
 The data available being restricted to patients visiting hospital may only reflect the tip of the iceberg but gives lead to Community Medicine Department</br> 
 and other researchers to explore these disorders in depth in the region.</br> 
 Hitherto untapped potentials of CPMS are being explored- epidemiological, behavioral, attitudinal, complex and rare disorders workup.</br> 
 Institute is also exploring possibility of using the cases for enhancing students’ learning and using case records as teaching tools.</br>

Diagnostic Services:</h2>
 The department of Biochemistry in this period has had several installations, </br> 
which has enhanced capabilities and added to new technology. Two Nova Biomedical ABG and</br> 
 Av5800 Fully Automated Biochemistry analyser were installed enhancing the pre-existing capabilities.</br> 
 In addition gel documentation system, HPLC, Flow Cytometer, PCR and</br> 
 RT-PCR have been installed which adds to technology in the delivery of sophisticated tests and research facility.</br> 
 The department performed and reported on 20,000 tests during the period, which had a spread over a wide menu of tests. </br> 
A total of 7000 electrolyte analysis were carried out and 7000 hormonal assays were carried out. </br> 
The department of Microbiology performed the following investigations during the period. </br> 
1) Bacteriology Lab: Culture & Smear microscopy – 3913 </br> 
2) Blood cultures using fully Automated Blood cultures system (BACTEC-FX and BacT/ALERT-3D) – 739 </br> 
3) Serological tests (Bacterial and Viral) – 12213 </br> 
4) Stool examination & PBS for Parasites – 642 </br> 
5) Fungal smear & culture – 199</br> 
 6) AFB smear and mycobacterial culture – 1300</br> 
 7) Mantoux tests – 288 </br> 
8) Microscopy under DOTS – 868</br> 
 9) HIV screening under ICTC – 1077 </br> 
10) STI screening under STI clinic – 85</br> 
 The department of Pathology which already had a state of the art automated walk away histopathology Lab added to its capability by new installations. </br> 
A modular grossing stations was installed which has the capability of image capture, Video photography and a Dictaphone. </br> 
A fully automated haematology analyser and fully automated coagulation platform was installed enhancing the haematology arm of Pathology.</br> 
 One pentahead microscopy and six faculty microscopes have also been installed. The following tests were performed during the period: 
1) CBC – 19109</br> 
2) ESR (Automated) – 4283</br> 
 3) PBF – 1524</br> 
 4) Urine – 10476</br> 
 5) Referral Histopathology – 185</br> 
 6) Histopathology – 3578</br> 
 7) IHC – 1116</br> 
 8) PAP – 979 </br> 
9) FNAC – 1332</br> 
 10) MP – 71 </br> 
11) BM – 26 </br> 
12) Retic – 293 Total – 42972 The radiology services at AHC ,Bijnor are totally paperless from the very beginning.</br>
